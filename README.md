# Pygame Workshop!
Learn how to create games with Python by creating your first basic game with Pygame!


# What is Pygame? 

Pygame is a open-source library that streamlines the process of drawing images and shapes to a display! What that means is that unlike game engines (or applications that allow you to build games), Pygame does not have its own physics system or lighting systems. 

What is interesting about this is that it gives us as programmers a ton of control about the systems that make up our game! It also is very easy to get started with, free, and open-source! Open-source means that all of the code that is running behind the scenes is publicly available meaning that the developers will never be able to charge money for Pygame and the community can always choose to take the code and make their own versions!
